# nx-apollo-auto-generate-types

My blog post about this repo: https://www.marcveens.nl/posts/nx-apollo-auto-generate-types

Run the project locally:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run serve` or `nx serve`

Enjoy the automatic generation of Typescript types based on GraphQL type definitions! ðŸ¥³

I added a custom Webpack plugin to automatically trigger the generation command every time a watch event occurs or when a build is triggered. Change something in `packages/apollo-server/src/schema/typeDefs.ts` and `packages/apollo-server/src/types/graphql-types.ts` is automatically renewed.
